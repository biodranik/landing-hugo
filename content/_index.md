VibroBox is NOT an “old-school” predictive maintenance or condition monitoring system. We call it *prescriptive* or *proactive* diagnostics for Industry 4.0 and IIoT.

We are targeting global equipment maintenance market, focusing on *actionable maintenance events* to avoid failures and optimize equipment's efficiency. As a part of ERP/MES/CMMS system, VibroBox automatically generates detailed maintenance instructions for *internal parts* of machinery *weeks* or *months* before a breakdown.

Simple actions such as timely replacement of oil in a bearing or shafts recalibration in a gearbox significantly *extend equipment's life* and radically *reduce expenses* on all related business processes in the enterprise.

We successfully tested our algorithms and vibration sensors in real conditions at industrial facilities in Belarus. Tested machinery includes (but not limited to) wind turbine, pumps, compressors, rolling mill, engines, rotors, wheel pairs of cargo trucks and trains.

VibroBox is easily *scalable*. New machinery is supported in a *few days*, not in months or years. Our algorithms work with a digital model of equipment created from a kinematic diagram and focus on a *digital signal processing* before using machine learning frameworks.
