VibroBox is a *prescriptive* diagnostics system for rotary and reciprocating equipment.

Our DSP and ML algorithms analyze vibration signals, create a "digital twin" of equipment and generate detailed diagnostics reports and *maintenance instructions* to avoid failures and breakdowns.

VibroBox is *scalable* and supports new equipment in just 3 days.

Everything is automated, so you don't need human experts any more.
