VibroBox is a *prescriptive* diagnostics system for rotary equipment and dumper trucks.

Our software and hardware analyze vibration signals, create a "digital twin" of equipment, and generate detailed diagnostics reports and *maintenance instructions* to avoid failures and breakdowns.

VibroBox is horizontally and vertically *scalable* and supports new equipment in just several days.

Fully automated, 24/7 monitoring and diagnostics, so you don't need human experts any more.
