# VibroBox vibration diagnostics service was successfully tested at "BELGEE" car factory in Belarus

{{<date>}}

"Industry 4.0" is a European version of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) concept. This term is being frequently used by the industry leaders now.

Equipment condition evaluation systems play a major role in this concept. A technical condition of an industry equipment should be evaluated in a fully automated mode and without human intervention.
Further, enterprise management systems (CMMS, MES, ERP) should be notified about detected defects and required maintenance. Maintenance system will check if there are accessory parts available in the storage and order them if necessary. Then it will schedule the optimal equipment maintenance timeframe to avoid unnecessary interruptions. As a result, there is no need to completely disassemble and then assemble manufacturing line for maintenance diagnostics as well as to stop
production process for a long time.

We have developed [VibroBox]({{<relref "">}}) with a strong focus on the "Industry 4.0" concept. Predictive maintenance is impossible without a detailed list of internal defects and maintenance recommendations provided by automated vibration diagnostics. For this purpose, we have used various advanced technologies: cloud services to store and process data, machine learning based on neural networks, wavelet analysis, custom basis functions, fuzzy logic rules, and other
digital signal processing algorithms.

For many years "[CITIC Construction](http://construction.citic/en/into/index.html)" (a subdivision of Chinese CITIC GROUP) has been one of the biggest [top-60](http://www.enr.com/toplists/2016-Top-250-International-Contractors1) international construction companies according to [ENR](http://www.enr.com/). From the very beginning the company has focused on attracting the most advanced technologies and business models.

"VibroBox" [system]({{<relref "technology.md#telemetry_sensors">}}) was installed on "[BELGEE](http://belgee.by/)" factory (Belarusian-Chinese joint venture to build "Geely" cars) in Zhodzina town to collect, transfer and analyze telemetry data. "VibroBox" capabilities have been demonstrated to evaluate a potential collaboration in the future. Vibration diagnostics was used on a pump and compressor equipment manufactured in China. "CITIC Construction" experts have accessed VibroBox [cloud]({{<demourl>}}) to analyze telemetry data and automatic reports about the technical condition of the evaluated equipment. CITIC Construction experts evaluated the results of diagnostics as highly informative and confirmed that the system worked consistently.
