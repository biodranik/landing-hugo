# Sitel company (trade name VibroBox) became a resident of High Technologies Park in Belarus

{{<date>}}

Since October 2019, VibroBox is [a resident](http://www.park.by/post-2495/) of the High Technology Park (HTP) in Belarus.

Here are some benefits of being a resident of HTP (also see a [more detailed summary]({{<resource "revera-htp-summary-en.pdf">}}) from [Revera](http://revera.by/en/) law firm):

* Exemption from all corporate taxes, including VAT, income tax, and customs duties.
* 9% individual income tax for employees and significant benefits for payments to the Social Security Fund.
* Benefits in international economic activities.
* Visa-free entry and temporary residence permit for foreign founders and employees.
* The ability to use certain institutions of English law, for example, a convertible loan, option and option agreement, non-competition agreement, as well as a possibility to use foreign law for shareholder agreements.
* The ability to use [Smart Contracts](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330028993_IOT_Enabled_Smart_Logistics_Using_Smart_Contracts) to complete and/or execute transactions (think of automated factories where VibroBox is a key element in maintenance and operations). By the way, Belarus is the first country in the world that [legalized](http://president.gov.by/ru/official_documents_ru/view/dekret-8-ot-21-dekabrja-2017-g-17716/) smart contracts at the country level.
