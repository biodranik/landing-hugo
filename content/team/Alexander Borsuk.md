Alexander graduated from the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics in 2004 majoring in “Computing Machines, Systems and Networks” of the Computer Systems and Networks Department.

Starting from 2003, he has been engaged in various projects in data processing, mobile development, and network communications. His vast engineering experience is perfectly complemented by leadership and business skills, travel experience, a healthy lifestyle and an active interest in biotechnology and medicine. Under Alexander’s direction, offline maps [MAPS.ME](https://maps.me/) for iPhone and Android devices got first 2.5 million users worldwide (now more than 100 million). With a team of 13 members the project became self-sustainable, and in November 2014 it was sold to [Mail.Ru Group](https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/13/mail-ru-buys-maps-me-to-integrate-crowdsourced-maps-into-its-my-com-app-portal/). After making the source code of [MAPS.ME](https://maps.me/) available under an open source license, creating a [map editor](https://venturebeat.com/2016/04/06/mapsme-openstreetmap-editing/) and successfully handing over all the responsibilities to the new team, Alexander invested his money, ideas and experience in VibroBox to help Dr. Davydov bring the project up to the international level and gain experience in the fields of digital signal processing, machine learning and science in general.
