Igor graduated from the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics (BSUIR) in 2002 with a degree in 'Radio Engineering Systems' of the Radio Engineering and Electronics Department, after which he entered post-graduate studies. His thesis titled “Ball bearing qualimetry system based on vibration signal analysis” was dedicated to promising methods of vibration signal analysis and was done in close cooperation with the testing laboratory of the Minsk Bearing Plant and the “Podshipnik” Research Institute. The defense of the thesis was held in 2006 in the Doctoral Council for Defending Dissertations D 02.05.13 at the Belarusian National Technical University.

Later on, Igor was engaged in the research, development, and adoption of decision-making systems based on machine learning and digital signal processing, designed among other things for condition monitoring of industrial equipment.

In 2008, his work “Software and hardware complex for evaluating of technical condition of mechanical engineering products” was presented at a number of international exhibitions and forums. The project was awarded the diploma of the 8th Moscow International Salon of Innovations and Investments, silver medals of the International Exhibition of Inventions and New Technologies “New Time” (Moscow, 2008) and 13th International Exhibition and Congress 'High Technologies. Innovation. Investments' (St. Petersburg, 2008).

Mr. Davydov is an expert in digital signal processing, machine learning, and decision-making systems. He has extensive experience in research and development, especially in the development and implementation of vibration-based condition monitoring systems. His area of expertise is the development of decision-making systems based on machine learning, methods, and software for equipment condition monitoring via vibroacoustic signals.

Igor is also a thesis advisor and teaching professor at the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics at the Department of Information Technology.
