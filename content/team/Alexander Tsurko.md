In VibroBox Alexander develops the expert system for vibration diagnostics. He also works on the equipment which records vibration signals and telemetry data. His current research is adaptive data analysis using digital signal processing, data science and artificial intelligence.

He has more than five years of experience in many projects, including embedded digital systems design and programming, DSP and telemetry, FPGA, satellite communication technologies, machine learning, cybernetics. He has also led teams of developers and researchers.

In 2012 he graduated from Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics with a bachelor's degree in Radioinformatics engineering. Later, in 2013, he received a master's degree in Technical Sciences. The title of his thesis is Adaptive algorithms for early detection of rolling bearing defects by vibration signals.

Now he is a postgraduate student and prepares to defend his Ph.D. thesis in System Analysis.

Currently Alexander is collaborating with BSUIR as a research scientist and assistant of Information Radiotechnologies Department.  His interests include the future of humanity and sustainable development of culture and nature. The most favorite free time activities are walking, backpacking, cycling, sailing.
