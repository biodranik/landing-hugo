Ivan Trus is a Research Engineer in VibroBox and a Master's Degree student in Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics (BSUIR). He develops and tests feature extraction algorithms for acoustic signals and compiles representative datasets for classifiers. His areas of expertise and interest include data science and digital signal processing (DSP), in particular:

* DSP systems and theories of communication systems
* applying machine learning and neural networks to solve a real-world problems
* prototyping algorithms from the published scientific literature
* hands-on experience using Matlab and its toolboxes for applied and research tasks

Ivan studied at Higher State College of Communication (now Belarusian State Academy of Communications) majoring at the Faculty of Telecommunications from 2009 to 2013. He graduated as a Telecommunications Technician.

From 2013 to 2017 Ivan studied at BSUIR at the Faculty of Radioengineering and Electronics. In 2017 he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Radioinformatics engineering.
Now Ivan is a Master’s Degree student at BSUIR majoring in the specialty of Informational Radiotechnologies. His thesis is “The optimal set of informative features based on the analysis of acoustic signals.”
