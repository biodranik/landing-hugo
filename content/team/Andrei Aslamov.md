Andrei graduated from the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics in 2015 with a degree in “Radio-Electronic Systems” of the Radio Engineering and Electronics Department and also holds a Master's degree in technical sciences. He is currently engaged in scientific work as part of his postgraduate course at BSUIR “Mathematical support and software of computing machines, systems and computer networks run” by the Information Technology Software Division, Computer Networks and Systems Department.

His area of expertise is the development of evaluation methods for condition monitoring of industrial equipment based on vibration signal analysis. He has practical experience in designing and simulating multi-channel digital radio systems. He works at the Department of Digital Signal Processing of the VibroBox project. He develops and implements algorithms of adaptive filtering, performs wavelet and spectral analysis and verifies the informative features of defects based on fuzzy logic.

The theme of Master's thesis: “Synthesis and study of orthogonal pseudo-random signals”.
